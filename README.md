# Explanation

This project is an improvised UI based on the PHP assessment sent to me.
The application will find the payment and bonus days based on the year searched for and allow the user to download a CSV file with the data.
This is made to only work between the years 2000 and 2050 on purpose, to show further knowledge of React. The application is perfectly able to handle any year.
Please keep in mind that I gave a priority to functionality and speed, design is not the best but it was not my priority while developing this.
